# Commands

This plugin provides the following commands (sorted in the order that I find them useful subjectively) that are available from the [Command palette](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Command+palette), [Slash commands](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Slash+commands), or your [custom hotkeys](https://help.obsidian.md/Customization/Custom+hotkeys).

- [[Search modal|Search]]
	- Powerful especially when [[Search modal#Dataview queries|combined with Dataview]]!
- [[Proof environment|Insert proof]]
- Insert display math
	- "Properly" insert a display math `$$ ... $$` even inside a callout or a blockquote.
- [[Local settings|Open local settings for the current note]]
	- Also available from `More options` (three dots) menu or right-clicking the file explorer
- [[Theorem callouts#Insert a theorem callout via GUI|Insert theorem callout]]
	- For GUI lovers
- [[Migration from Math Booster version 1|Migrate from version 1]]
	- Don't forget to run this if you are using this plugin since Math Booster version 1!
- [[Equations#PDF export|Convert equation numbers in the current note to static \tag{}]]
	- This is supposed to be no longer necessary in version 2, because equation numbers can now be successfully printed in PDF export!
