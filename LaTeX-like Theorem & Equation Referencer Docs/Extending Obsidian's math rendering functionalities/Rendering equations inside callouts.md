# Rendering equations inside callouts

> [!important]
> This feature is planned to be removed from this plugin, and instead, it will be available as a separate plugin [**Better Math in Callouts & Blockquotes**](https://github.com/RyotaUshio/obsidian-math-in-callout), featuring a bunch of improvements. Currently awaiting for approval by the Obsidian team.

Obsidian doesn't render MathJax equations in calloutsÂ _while editing them_. This plugin gets this job done and makes your math note taking much more seamless.
