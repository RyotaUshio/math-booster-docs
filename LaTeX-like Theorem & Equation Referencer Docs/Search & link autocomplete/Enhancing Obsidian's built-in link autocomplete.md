# Enhancing Obsidian's built-in link autocomplete

> [!important]
> This feature is planned to be removed from this plugin in the near future, and instead, it will be available as a separate plugin [**Rendered Block Link Suggestions**](https://github.com/RyotaUshio/obsidian-rendered-block-link-suggestions), which supports all types of blocks not limited to display math. Currently awaiting for approval by the Obsidian team.

This plugin enhances Obsidian's built-in link autocomplete (the one that is triggered when you type `[[` in the editor) by displaying formatted theorem titles and rendered equations.
