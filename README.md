# Obsidian LaTeX-like Theorem & Equation Referencer Docs

This repository contains an Obsidian vault that generates the [documentation website](https://ryotaushio.github.io/obsidian-latex-theorem-equation-referencer/) for [LaTeX-like Theorem & Equation Referencer](https://github.com/RyotaUshio/obsidian-latex-theorem-equation-referencer), an [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) plugin for mathematical note-takers.

## Contributing to the docs

The vault is located under the `LaTeX-like Theorem & Equation Referencer Docs` folder of this repository. To contribute:

   ```
    git clone https://github.com/<YOUR NAME>/obsidian-latex-theorem-equation-referencer-docs.git
    ```
2. Open the `LaTeX-like Theorem & Equation Referencer Docs` folder under the cloned repository as an Obsidian vault ([Obsidian Help](https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Create+a+vault#Open+existing+folder)).
3. Make changes in Obsidian so that links are properly updated.
4. Commit & push your changes to the fork and [make a pull request](https://docs.github.com/ja/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to the original repository.
