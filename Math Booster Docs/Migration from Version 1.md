# Migration from Version 1

Among many improvements that Math Booster version 2 introduces is a [[Theorem callouts|new format for theorem callouts]], which is ***much cleaner, more intuitive, more keyboard-friendly, and less plugin-dependent*** than the old format used in version 1.

To fully enjoy version 2, run the command `Migrate from version 1` to convert the old format to the new one.
