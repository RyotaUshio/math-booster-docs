# Migration from Version 1

Among many improvements that Math Booster version 2 introduces is a [[Theorem callouts|new format for theorem callouts]], which is ***much cleaner, more intuitive, more keyboard-friendly, and less plugin-dependent*** than the old format used in version 1.

To fully enjoy version 2, run the command `Migrate from version 1` to convert the old format to the new one.

## What's new in version 2

- [[Theorem callouts|New format for theorem callouts]]:
	- much cleaner,
	- more intuitive,
	- more keyboard-friendly,
	- and less plugin-dependent than the previous format
- New indexing mechanism:
	- no longer blocks UI
	- no longer hard-codes theorem indices in notes directly
- [[Editor auto-completion]] improvements: filter theorems & equations (entire vault/recent notes/active note/dataview queries)
- [[Search modal]]: more control & flexibility than editor auto-completion
- Adding metadata to [[Theorem callouts#Adding metadata with comments|theorems]] and [[Equations#Adding metadata with comments|equations]] with comments
	- e.g. display name of equations
- Theorem/equation numbers now can be displayed *almost everywhere*:
