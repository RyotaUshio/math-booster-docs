I could not have created Math Booster without the following community plugins. I appreciate their hard work and a lot of inspirations.

## [Datacore](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/datacore) by [Michael "Tres" Brenan (blacksmithgu)](https://github.com/blacksmithgu)

Math Booster's [indexing mechanism](https://github.com/RyotaUshio/obsidian-math-booster/tree/master/src/index) is totally based on Datacore.

## [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) by [Michael "Tres" Brenan (blacksmithgu)](https://github.com/blacksmithgu)

In version 1, Math Booster had relied on Dataview to efficiently obtain backlinks for a specific equation.

In version 2, the backlink acquisition part was implemented by Math Booster itself (but the code was basically taken from his new plugin Datacore). But now Dataview provides a significant enhancement in Math Booster's [[Search modal]].

## [MathLinks](https://github.com/zhaoshenzhai/obsidian-mathlinks) by [Zhaoshen Zhai](tps://github.com/zhaoshenzhai)

Lovely plugin!

## [Latex Suite](https://github.com/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite/tree/main/src) by [artisticat](1https://github.com/artisticat1)

Dependency check style

## And of course...

A big thank you for the Obsidian team for prividing the foundation for the entire great ecosystem.
